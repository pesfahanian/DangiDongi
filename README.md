*[دَنگی-دُنگی]*

Equally split a tab of shared & respective items between its participants.

## Motivation
Ever been in a scenario where you go out for a bite with a bunch of friends and you all get some items for the table (_e.g._ fries), yet each person also gets something for themselves. Now splitting the bill equally (_i.e._ each person paying equally for the shared items and for their respective orders) while remembering who-ordered-what and so forth can be a bit cumbersome.
